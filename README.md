<h1>My Personal Blog</h1>


A simple blog made with gatsby and GraphQL, as a way for me to have a place to dot down my thoughts, as well anything development-related things I find interesting.

The posts are written in markdown (which is the best for writing, hands down), and GraphQL inserts each of the posts in the md-pages-folder into the schema.

The index route queries for the newest posts and gives you a short excerpt of each, and there is a template for each blog post, that populates itself with the data that gets queried from the slug. 


And yes, it is supposed to look like that, I wanted to make the most barebones-blog you can think of. I wanted to focus on simplicity, as to make it more like an empty notepad, instead of a flashy blogging site.
