##A small update

I am currently at my parents cabin, in the HÃ¸nefoss-area in Norway. It has been mostly raining here, but I've been able to do some renovations on our boat, and go for a walk or two. 

I haven't worked on any projects as of lately, as I am focusing more on solidifying my knowledge in more advanced JavaScript topics, so I am working more with theory right now, instead of project-practice. Must say, prototypal inheritance and closures drive me crazy.

I still need some more work with asynchronous JavaScript, as well as modules, before I feel 90% comfortable with JS (Can never achieve 100% in anything, that's just stupid). After that I'll most likely start doing some coding challenges as interview preparation, as I have a series of interviews lined up for august.
