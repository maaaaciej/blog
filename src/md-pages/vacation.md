##What I've been up to lately

I've had an amazing couple of days in Rjukan, arguely one of the most beautiful places on earth. I've been on so many hikes, spent some valuable time with my family and most importantly got to let my brain rest, after half a year of 10-hour days of studying. I now feel more energized and ready to tackle more challenges. 

My august is filled to the brim with interviews for different developer positions, and since coming back on Thursday, I've been focused on polishing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, doing coding challenges, as well as planning out any improvements I can make to my existing projects. 

I must say that I miss doing work in React, but also that I've found the things I've been learning lately have greatly improved my deeper understanding of JS, as well as computer science in general. I think I'll spend some time on a project or two, just to take a break from searching-algorithms and binary trees.
