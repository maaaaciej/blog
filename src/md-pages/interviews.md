##Interviews

I've had the last two weeks packed with interviews, and must admit that I've now experienced the good, the bad and the ugly side of them. The good ones were really good. Got to show off my portfolio projects I've spent countless hours on, I felt that I got to know the culture-side of the companies as well as getting to feel that I could be a great fit personality and tech-stack-wise. The bad ones left me with a taste of somehow being misunderstood, as I went in with the expectations of showing off my skills, and talking about technology, but rather got rejected before I got to the technical interview-part. No hard feelings though, as I strive to never burn any bridges, as you never know how things might change in the future.

So far I'm in the process of getting my first offer, one I'm quite happy with, however I'm debating on wether or not I should accept it, as I've interviewed with this is one company that really stuck out from the rest, and checked of all the right boxes for me. I hope to hear from them tomorrow, I think that's when they're supposed to get back to me. I believe that I will be handed a take-home-test from them, and you can be sure that I'll do everything I can to ace it, as I really want the job!

Will probably come back here with an update in about a weeks time, stay tuned!
