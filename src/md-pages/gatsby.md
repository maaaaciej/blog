### Thoughts on Gatsby.

I made this blog as a small challenge and practice project, to solidify my knowledge of graphQL, as well as Gatsby. To be quite honest, I don't really like gatsby all that much. 

The setup as well as the whole development process was more complicated than it seems that it needs to be, but I do feel more comfortable with using it now. Hey, I did make a blog for myself, so it is useful for something. 

Now that I'm writing this, I'm starting to fall more and more in love with the simple theme. Not having any buttons, inputs or anything more than the minimum is quite pleasant to read, even though it's ugly. However, I think that I'll give the post templates, as well as the index route some more padding, as they feel kind of crammed.
